# :wave: Hello! :wave:

Welcome to my Lab repository.

Here you find all the projects I am working on - this includes those not deployed to my home lab (which can be found on the HomeLab repo).

Many of the files here will just be simple python projects to start with, as well as some bash scripts. Eventually, the aim is implement Docker and add these projects to that, and eventually run a Kubernetes cluster on my home lab.

As such, this will be my staging / test grounds, and you'll be able to see through my commits how it's grown and evolved.
